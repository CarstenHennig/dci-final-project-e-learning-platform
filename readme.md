## Discussion / Design Thinking

Meta Platform ‚How to learn‘
Create and mix your individual learning modules:

- Blog publishing (text module)
- Video tutorials (video module, video playlist)
- Explaining podcasts (audio module)
- Peer-to-peer learning (chat module)
- Tutorials for creating e-learning content (how to guidelines for texts, videos, podcasts, didactics, principles of user-generated content)

Open Source Solution with beta version (including basic modules) -> DCI community is invited to develop new modules, improve modules, create specific business apps and using the solution for a topic-focussed e-learning platform (i.e. SEO Basics, React Development tbc)

First steps of project management following design thinking process:

- Defining target groups
- Designing market research (web crawl) AND survey
- Defining unique selling propositions (USP) and main purpose for our target groups

To do:

- Create presentation of project idea
- Create very first raw UI
