PLEASE READ THIS AND LET US MEET IN THE NEXT 5 MINUTES Pump new energy into our project.
Please, we are in this together. It is my honest wish that none of us should feel inadequate. Myself I am still struggling with lots of stuff. BUt I trust we shall overcome in the end!

Let's look at it this way:

Agreeing that we are dropping the CHAT function
Agreeing that we suspend the video blog function
We are left with a text CMS System

## TEXT CMS System involves 
GUI with FOUR PRINCIPAL features
1) Home Page containing display of blog articles by category
2) User profile page  - to manage user info like name, address, number of posts, etc
3) Blog writing interface - where the user can write blog posts, embed videos, audios, upload photos
4) Reading Interface: where the article gets loaded when user clicks a title
   - Reading interface permits users to comment, like, dislike
   - Reading interface also includes links to other categories and recommended articles   

=============
IF WE ARE COOL WITH THE ABOVE THEN THE NEXT STEP IS WHO WILL CODE WHAT?

FERDINAND: Lead Backend Developer, supplies all APIs needed by frontend 
KARIN: Lead Frontend Developer 
CARSTEN: Frontend Developer but can also take backend tasks as need be

=============

SO FAR WHAT HAS BEEN HANDLED?

BACKEND (Ferdinand): User signup, login, profile API
FRONTEND (Karin): User signup, login accessing server already
NON_CODE TASKS (Carsten):  About Page, (And what else? Please fill the gaps)


TASKS TO HANDLE: We have to carve out tasks based on the GUI features listed above.
